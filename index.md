# QDA Tag Tree for LibreOffice

â€¦Qualitative Data Analysis is not easy. And if you don't want to spend a large amount of money, you are back to very basic methods when you code your data. Some people [use word processors for analysis](https://www.slideshare.net/jennacondie/working-with-word-for-qualitative-data-analysis) as a wide spread and affordable alternative. 

*QDA Tag Tree* builds on that and enhances [LibreOffice Writer](http://www.libreoffice.org/) (a free word processor): It adds a sidebar that allows you to view all your codes (also called *tags* here, since they are written as *#hashtags*).

The codes are written in the standard comments, so transcribed text and codes can stay separate.

You wonâ€™t see anything interesting yet, because you have not coded your data, yet. 

**Create comments:**  Mark a text you want to code and create a comment (Ctrl+Alt+C)

**Writing Codes:** Assign your codes: Just write a *#Hashtag* in the comment. QDA Tag Tree will recognize these as codes. The content of a comment can thus look like this: 

> #fun #analysis 

Other text in comments with the #hashtags works, too: 

> #fun #analysis Note to self: Is fun the right code here? I think we might want to discuss its definition. 

You can also create sub codes that will show as child codes in the tree: 

> #fun #analysis#review

Which will create a tree-group with text-sections coded with #fun and another tree-group #analysis with a child group #review. This way you can keep the overview. 


**Donâ€™t forget to press *update* to update the tag tree.** 

**Review Codes:** If you click on an item in the tree that represents coded text (the ones without a fold/unfold icon and a *#*) you can see the coded text in the upper part of the panel. If "jump to clicked Tag" is checked, it will  scroll the document to the coded text.
