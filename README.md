A libre office addon that finds comments that have #hashtags in them. It shows all these comments in a tree control in the sidebar (after the user pressed the update button). 

State: Alpha

To build it, just zip the content and change the file extension to *oxt* â€“ which makes this a Libreoffice Extension which you can install. 

Scaffold code was generated using [unodit](https://github.com/kelsa-pi/unodit). This would not have been possible without its use.
